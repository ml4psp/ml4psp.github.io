			<p>One is Not Enough</br>Thoughts on Choosing Data-Model Comparison Metrics</p>
                        <p>The magnetospheric physics research community uses a broad array of quantitative data-model comparison methods – metrics – when conducting their research investigations. It is often the case, though, that any particular study will only use one or two metrics. Because metrics are designed to test a specific aspect of the data-model relationship, limiting the comparison to only one or two metrics reduces the physical insights that can be gleaned from the analysis, restricting the possible findings from such studies. Additional physical insights can be obtained when many types of metrics are applied. A few best practices for choosing metrics for space physics studies are presented and discussed.</p>

			<p>One essential component of operational space weather forecasting is the prediction of solar flares. Early flare forecasting work focused on statistical methods based on historical flaring rates, and more complex machine learning based methods have been implemented in recent years. A multitude of flare forecasting methods are now available for operational use, and proper evaluation of these products is crucially important for model developers, forecasters, end-users, and stakeholders because it facilitates an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the forecasting process. This talk will outline current collaborative efforts in solar flare forecasting that are driving international standards based on terrestrial weather forecasting practices, such as defining evaluation metrics, climatological benchmarking, and ensemble requirements.</p>

                        <p>A new MESSENGER FIPS dataset is introduced, where the 𝜅-distribution function is fitted numerically to proton spectra, providing more accurate estimates of density and temperature than previous Maxwellian fits. The quality of the fitted distribution functions are then assessed using modular artificial neural networks in order to remove badly fitted spectra. The new moments are then used to train a deep artificial neural network in order to create a scalable 3D proton model for Mercury's magnetosphere.</p>

	                    <p>Upcoming missions to remote destinations like Jupiter's moon Europa will operate at extreme distances from the Earth where direct human oversight is impossible.  The combination of extreme distance, limited lifetime due to high radiation, and limited data downlink creates an urgent need for reliable autonomous operations.  Machine learning can help by analyzing data for features of interest as it is collected.  Data with positive detections can be marked for high-priority downlink to Earth for mission planning.  For Europa, such features include thermal anomalies, active icy plumes, and unusual surface mineral deposits.  This talk describes data analysis and machine learning methods that can operate onboard to increase the rate of exploration and discovery.</p>

                        <p>Global-scale energy flow throughout Earth's magnetosphere is catalyzed by processes that occur at Earth's magnetopause (MP). Magnetic reconnection is one process responsible for solar wind entry into and global convection within the magnetosphere, and the MP location, orientation, and motion have an impact on the dynamics. Statistical studies that focus on these and other MP phenomena and characteristics inherently require MP identification in their event search criteria, a task that can be automated using machine learning. We introduce a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network model into the operational data stream of the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission to free up mission operation costs, detect MP crossings, and assist studies of energy transfer into the magnetosphere. </p>

                        <p> Machine Learning Algorithms for Automated Detection of Boundary Crossings: A Case Study from Cassini </p>
                        <p>As increasingly data-intensive sensors are developed for downlink-constrained deep-space missions, scientists face a future in which only a small portion of the science data collected by the spacecraft can be sent back to Earth. There’s a rapidly increasing need to develop “smart” autonomous algorithms capable of rudimentary science analysis on-board the spacecraft so that the downlink bandwidth can be optimized for the most relevant observations. Here, we present one such case study from the Cassini mission where we have utilized machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify whether the spacecraft was in the magnetosphere, magnetosheath or solar wind, utilizing a set of labeled magnetopause and bow shock crossings spanning from 2004 – 2016. We analyze the overall accuracy of various ML algorithms – Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) – utilizing combinations of features from the magnetometer (MAG), Charge Mass Spectrometer (CHEMS) and Low-Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS).</p>

                        <p>Disentangling the planetary signal from the stellar and instrumental noise is a major data and modelling challenge with inevitable repercussions for transits detection and characterisation. Here we consider approaches to leverage  the power of deep learning and help tackling this challenge. After discussing a LSTM-based method to model the noise in Spitzer light curve observations, we present preliminary studies aiming at developing an end-to-end differentiable pipeline combining the flexibility and scalability of neural networks with the precision and domain knowledge borne by physical models.</p>
