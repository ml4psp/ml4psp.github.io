		    	<p> Exploring subsurface oceans on icy moons is a key goal in the search for habitable environments. 
				Because these moons are embedded in the time-varying magnetosphere of their host planet, their saltwater oceans generate an induced magnetic field detectable by spacecraft. 
				Such measurements provide a tool to detect and characterize these ocean worlds. 
				As part of the design of the upcoming Europa Clipper mission, we have developed a technique for ocean characterization using spacecraft magnetometry and Bayesian inference. 
				This approach allows for the recovery of the ocean parameters with robust uncertainties and enables incorporating multiple datasets into a self-consistent view of Europa's interior. 
				I will discuss the application of this technique to the upcoming Europa Clipper mission, archival data from Galileo, and possible future missions to the ice giants. </p>

	                    <p>Upcoming missions to remote destinations like Jupiter's moon Europa will operate at extreme distances from the Earth where direct human oversight is impossible.  The combination of extreme distance, limited lifetime due to high radiation, and limited data downlink creates an urgent need for reliable autonomous operations.  Machine learning can help by analyzing data for features of interest as it is collected.  Data with positive detections can be marked for high-priority downlink to Earth for mission planning.  For Europa, such features include thermal anomalies, active icy plumes, and unusual surface mineral deposits.  This talk describes data analysis and machine learning methods that can operate onboard to increase the rate of exploration and discovery.</p>

                        <p>Global-scale energy flow throughout Earth's magnetosphere is catalyzed by processes that occur at Earth's magnetopause (MP). Magnetic reconnection is one process responsible for solar wind entry into and global convection within the magnetosphere, and the MP location, orientation, and motion have an impact on the dynamics. Statistical studies that focus on these and other MP phenomena and characteristics inherently require MP identification in their event search criteria, a task that can be automated using machine learning. We introduce a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network model into the operational data stream of the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission to free up mission operation costs, detect MP crossings, and assist studies of energy transfer into the magnetosphere. </p>

                        <p>As increasingly data-intensive sensors are developed for downlink-constrained deep-space missions, scientists face a future in which only a small portion of the science data collected by the spacecraft can be sent back to Earth. There’s a rapidly increasing need to develop “smart” autonomous algorithms capable of rudimentary science analysis on-board the spacecraft so that the downlink bandwidth can be optimized for the most relevant observations. Here, we present one such case study from the Cassini mission where we have utilized machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify whether the spacecraft was in the magnetosphere, magnetosheath or solar wind, utilizing a set of labeled magnetopause and bow shock crossings spanning from 2004 – 2016. We analyze the overall accuracy of various ML algorithms – Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) – utilizing combinations of features from the magnetometer (MAG), Charge Mass Spectrometer (CHEMS) and Low-Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS).</p>

			<p>One is Not Enough</br>Thoughts on Choosing Data-Model Comparison Metrics</p>
                        <p>The magnetospheric physics research community uses a broad array of quantitative data-model comparison methods – metrics – when conducting their research investigations. It is often the case, though, that any particular study will only use one or two metrics. Because metrics are designed to test a specific aspect of the data-model relationship, limiting the comparison to only one or two metrics reduces the physical insights that can be gleaned from the analysis, restricting the possible findings from such studies. Additional physical insights can be obtained when many types of metrics are applied. A few best practices for choosing metrics for space physics studies are presented and discussed.</p>

			<p>One essential component of operational space weather forecasting is the prediction of solar flares. Early flare forecasting work focused on statistical methods based on historical flaring rates, and more complex machine learning based methods have been implemented in recent years. A multitude of flare forecasting methods are now available for operational use, and proper evaluation of these products is crucially important for model developers, forecasters, end-users, and stakeholders because it facilitates an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the forecasting process. This talk will outline current collaborative efforts in solar flare forecasting that are driving international standards based on terrestrial weather forecasting practices, such as defining evaluation metrics, climatological benchmarking, and ensemble requirements.</p>

                        <p>The products of magnetic reconnection in Saturn's magnetotail are identified in magnetometer observations primarily through characteristic deviations in the north-south component of the magnetic field. Identification of these features has long been performed by human observers, however with the advent of sophisticated computational methods, it is time to automate our search for these reconnection signatures. Here, we present a fully automated, supervised learning, feed forward neural network model to identify evidence of reconnection in the Kronian magnetosphere with the three magnetic field components observed by the Cassini spacecraft in Kronocentric radial-theta-phi (KRTP) coordinates as input. Furthermore, we present methods to validate results of machine learning algorithms when they are applied to extended datasets that originate in differing background environments than those trained, tested and validated against.</p>

	    		<p>Automatic detection of barchan dunes on Mars employing an instance segmentation neural network</p>
                        <p>The surface of Mars is riddled with dunes created by accumulating sand particles that are carried by the wind. When the sand supply is limited and the wind is approximately unidirectional, dunes take the form of crescents termed barchan dunes, whose slip faces are oriented in the dominant wind direction. Consequently, analyzing the morphometrics of barchan dunes can help characterize the winds that form them. Previously, local circulation patterns were derived by analyzing individual images of barchan dunes near the North Pole of Mars <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/JB084iB14p08167">[1]</a>. However, repeating this analysis on a global scale remains a challenge, as manually mapping dunes is largely impractical and traditional computer vision algorithms are largely ineffective at identifying the outlines of dunes from images. Here we employ Mask R-CNN <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870">[2]</a>, an instance segmentation convolutional neural network, to map dunes across the surface of Mars. Training on ~1000 images, our model achieves a mean average detection precision (mAP) of 80%, for IoU = 0.5. In the talk, I will describe the Mask R-CNN neural network and its vast space of hyperparameters, and how those can be employed for object detection and analysis by incorporating traditional computer vision techniques.</p>

			<p>Novelty-Guided Target Selection for Mars Rovers</p>
			<p>Mars rover operations currently consists of pre-scripted commands determined by the rover science and engineering operations teams on a day-to-day (or sol-to-sol) basis. Automated instrument targeting systems, which determine which surface features to target based on automated rather than pre-scripted decision-making, could help increase the science return from current and future exploration missions. To enable automatic follow-up observation of novel targets—i.e., targets that differ substantially from those observed previously in the mission—we propose to use novelty detection algorithms for ranking candidate targets detected in rover images. In this talk, I will present our proposed onboard novelty detection framework and illustrate its utility using diverse scenarios of novel geology found in Mars rover images.</p>

			<p> Machine learning reconstruction of the inner magnetosphere </p>
			<p> While the volumes of space physics data continue to rise exponentially, our analysis techniques have not kept pace with this rapid growth, and often do not exploit the full potential of the data. In this talk, we discuss how machine learning might provide the solution to this problem, and in particular we will show how a (sparse) time-series of point observations of some quantity can be converted into a 3-dimensional time-varying model of that quantity with the use of neural networks.   As an example, we show a three-dimensional dynamic electron density (DEN3D) model in the inner magnetosphere, that can provide full coverage of the inner magnetosphere and in fact is sufficiently accurate that it points the way to new physical discoveries. The talk will be concluded with a few emerging ideas of how machine learning can be applied in the physical sciences. </p>

			<p> Deep-Ensemble Modelling of Electron Flux at the Radiation Belt’s Outer Boundary With Bayesian Neural Networks <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rbflux-bnn">[website]</a></p>
			<p> As space-based infrastructure becomes more ubiquitous, modelling the radiation belts is increasingly important. Most radiation belt models require an accurate outer boundary condition, as this helps to drives the simulation. Our work aims to characterise the flux-energy distribution at the outer boundary location using an ensemble of Bayesian neural networks. Each model in the ensemble predicts 11 values of flux, and the associated variance, for each set of inputs.  The model performs well, predicting fluxes within a factor of 2.5 for the lower energies and within a factor of 4 for the higher energies (with a correlation between 0.5-0.8). </p>

				Space weather is the impact of solar energy on society and is a powerful use case for demonstrating the ability of data science to converge disciplines. 
				A key to understanding it is the way that regions of space between the Sun and the Earth’s surface are connected, particularly via particles transferred from the solar wind to the magnetosphere to the upper atmosphere—a problem that remains one of the great challenges in space physics. 
				We will first present a new ML model that better captures the dynamics of the particle precipitation from a large volume of data. 
				We will then share a new framework to evaluate and understand these models.
				We will generalize this progress as suggestive of trends that reverberate across all scientific disciplines and that even tie science to engineering, art, and design. 
				We will raise generative questions about how we currently do AI/ML research in space physics, about the role of information representation in progressing space physics discovery (e.g., knowledge networks), and to provide insight to and spark discussion for this cross-disciplinarity community around the concepts of convergence and antidisciplinary.</p>

		        <p> Detecting Cave Entrance Candidates on Mars using Deep Learning Computer Vision </p>
			<p>In the framework of geological exploration of terrestrial planets, sinkhole-like landforms (pit craters, pit chains and skylights), as a potential direct access to the subsurface, are one of the most promising environments to focus our research.
				Detecting, mapping, and describing those types of landforms is a challenging process since a set of tedious tasks must be conducted manually by researchers, usually on a small set of available data. 
				These tasks vary from data collection (in which areas with high probability of occurrences are selected and downloaded) to manual analysis that requires viewing the images in detail, mapping all occurrences with GIS, and extracting morphometric parameters.
				For the Moon and Mars, databases of cave candidates exist (see MGC^3 Cushing, 2012) but all of these databases are focused on small regions, rather than at planetary scale. 
				Thus there are possible missing correlations between the presence of these landforms and the area of detection that can be related to past and present processes.
				To achieve data analyses at planetary scale, machine learning and deep learning algorithms are extremely valuables techniques, capable of automatically analysing large datasets. 
				The main problem is that often it is necessary to develop specific tools and pipelines for this task.
				Two jupyter notebooks have been developed around FOSS Object Detection packages and used with a small dataset of 130 high resolution images acquired by the HiRISE camera from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. 
				The aim of these is to create an user-friendly environment for training and evaluating an object detection model; not only for cave candidates but also for other types of landforms. 
				These results have been compared to available databases with preliminary promising results.</p>

			<p> Reproducibility in Space Sciences </br> Do we really need to publish our codes? </p>
			<p> Reproducibility is without a doubt one of the fundamental pillars of science, and just as science has evolved through time, so has the concept of what is necessary to ensure results are reproducible. Historically, the publication of source code used for analysis, modeling, and even for figures has never been a requirement in Space Sciences and it has rarely been encouraged as a necessary practice. A possible explanation may be the assumption that reproducibility is “baked in” the physics of the systems or in the data. However, as Machine Learning becomes an integral part of Space Sciences research, the requirement that the codes developed for research are publicly available, or at least can be obtained on demand grows in popularity. Today, many publishers are encouraging code sharing, or even straight up requiring it now or in the near future.  This talk will stray away from the traditional discussions on techniques and applications of machine learning for space and planetary sciences and focus on the topics of whether code sharing is the best practice to ensure reproducibility, with the idea of starting a conversation on whether we should push for or against code sharing as a community, and how should we prepare for it if it becomes the norm moving forward. </p>

			<p> Deep Learning on Jovian Decametric Emissions </br> - </p>
			<p> Jupiter's decametric radio emissions have long been a valuable tool for understanding the magnetic properties of Jupiter and its interactions with its major satellites. Decametric emissions are variable on many timescales, but high-resolution observations produce huge data that can't be stored for long. Using convolutional neural networks, we try to detect, classify and  locate Jovian emissions in the observations by the Nançay decameter array. This will lead to an automated method to select the high resolution data to be archived. See predictions from this network <a href="https://voparis-minerva-jupiter.obspm.fr/">online</a>. </p>
