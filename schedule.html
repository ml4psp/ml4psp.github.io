			 <p> Fundamental analyses of quantification accuracy in rock spectra using machine learning </p>
			 <p> With a focus on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) applications on Mars with ChemCam, I have studied various influences on elemental quantification in rocks using a suite of LIBS spectra from almost 3,000 geological standards. Rock spectra are notoriously complex and it is difficult to build robust and accurate predictive models for unknowns on remote surfaces. From this work I have discovered pros and cons of various machine learning methods, effects of data set size and diversity, and compared results to traditional methods. The moral of the story is: the more data, the better! </p>

			 <p> Ranking the Drivers of the Martian Bow Shock Location </p>
			 <p> The Martian interaction with the solar wind leads to the formation of a bow shock upstream of the planet. The shock dynamics appears complex, due to the combined influence of external and internal drivers. In this talk, we will compare the influence of the main drivers of the Martian shock location, based on several methods and published datasets from Mars Express (MEX) and Mars Atmosphere Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) missions. We include here the influence of the crustal fields, extreme ultraviolet fluxes, solar wind dynamic pressure, magnetosonic Mach number and Interplanetary Magnetic Field parameters. The bias due to the cross-correlations among the possible drivers is investigated with a partial correlations analysis. Several model selection methods (Akaike Information Criterion and Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator regression) are also used to rank the relative importance of the physical parameters. We will also mention several recent works including machine learning, such as the martien shock detection or the identification of magnetic reconnection Electron Diffusion Regions at the Earth’s magnetopause. </p>

				<h3> Annie Didier </br> NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory </h3>
				<p> Incepting Interplanetary “Google Search” through Machine Learning </p>
				<p>Spacecraft can produce a far greater volume of data than can be downlinked. 
					Though interplanetary communication rates have grown in orders of magnitude since early missions, they are far surpassed by the growth in data volume produced by on-board instruments. 
					To bypass the communication bottleneck between spacecraft and ground while optimizing scientific yield, we propose the concept of ‘Interplanetary Google Search,’ a novel approach to spacecraft data retrieval inspired by the Google search engine. 
					We envision a selective downlink capability with on-board indexing and search where scientists can query a spacecraft’s on-board database for specific, relevant information. 
					To realize this on-board data storage and indexing vision, we must first introduce the means to extract features relevant to scientific interest from historic data payloads. 
					The key to our approach is utilizing machine learning to extract features and summarize data. 
					We have demonstrated this capability using image segmentation and image captioning models of MSL RGB imagery. 
					Such methods would, for instance, enable scientists to download a full textual summary of the imagery taken by a rover and use this information to downlink data with specific features for further analysis. 
					This concept has even more potential for a wider range of deep-space missions with more data-intensive instruments (e.g. ground-penetrating radar and hyperspectral imagers), and can be realized with the application of data science.</p>

			 	<p>Applying unsupervised learning and outlier detection methods to characterise magnetotail electrons</p>
			 	<p>Collisionless space plasma environments are characterised by distinct particle populations that typically do not mix. 
				 Although moments of their velocity distributions help in distinguishing different plasma regimes, the distribution functions themselves provide more comprehensive information about the plasma state. 
				 Unlike moments, however, distributions are not easily characterised by a small number of parameters, making their classification more difficult. 
				 To perform this classification, we distinguish between the different plasma regions by applying dimensionality reduction and clustering methods to electron distributions in pitch angle and energy space. 
				 The automated classification of different regions in space plasma environments provides a useful tool to identify the physical processes governing particle populations in near-Earth space. 
				 Using outlier detection methods, we can identify anomalous distributions in the magnetotail that are consistent with simulations of the tearing instability.</p>

			 <p>  Automated bow shock and magnetopause boundary detection with Cassini </p>
			 <p> The Cassini mission spent 13 years in orbit around Saturn collecting a wealth of data about its magnetic field and plasma populations.
				 A catalogue of bow shock and magnetopause boundary crossings is needed to study the structure of Saturn’s magnetosphere and fundamental plasma processes like instabilities. 
				 However, a very challenging aspect is the manual identification of thousands of crossings. It is both time-consuming and prone to human error. 
				 This calls for ways to standardize the detection of these boundaries through automation. 
				 A range of techniques is explored from traditional time-series analysis on the magnetic field and plasma moments data to modern machine learning techniques like evidential deep learning which quantify classification uncertainty applied to electron energy spectrograms.

			     <p> Characterizing the ExoMars landing site at Oxia Planum using deep learning </p>
			     <p> In this study a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network was trained to characterize the landscape of Oxia Planum, Mars. 
				     This work was conducted as part of the preparation for the European Space Agency’s upcoming ExoMars Rosalind Franklin Rover mission. 
				     The aim was to develop an ontology of terrain classes, which could be applied across the landing site and beyond, to form a component to traversability analysis, when combined with engineering information about the rover, and with “ground truth” information about how the classes look once Rosalind Franklin lands. 
				     Studies combining high resolution images with large spatial extents, such as the full 3-sigma potential landing ellipse, present significant challenges.
				     Mapping or surveying large areas at full resolution becomes massively time consuming, or requires very large teams to do effectively.
				     One solution is using machine learning systems to classify images by semantic segmentation. 
				     This approach can provide a useful tool to augment the workflow of human geomorphologists, “triaging” extremely large, high resolution datasets to identify concentrations of certain textures or landforms. 
				     I will discuss the process of developing the Oxia planum training dataset, and our assessment of the results.

				<h3> Anirudh Koul </br> Pinterest, NASA Frontier Development Lab </h3>
				<p> SpaceML Worldview Search: The NoCode Earth & Natural Disaster Dataset Curator from Unlabeled Petabyte Scale Imagery </p>
				<p> AI modeling for Earth events at NASA is often limited by the availability of labeled examples. 
					For example, training classifiers to detect forest fires from satellite imagery requires curating a massive and diverse dataset of example forest fires, a tedious multi-month effort requiring careful review of over 196 million square miles of data per day for 20 years. 
					While such images might exist in abundance within 40 petabytes of unlabeled satellite data, finding these positive examples to include in a training dataset for a machine learning model is extremely time-consuming and requires researchers to "hunt" for positive examples, like finding a needle in a haystack.

					In this presentation, we showcase a no-code open-source tool built by an international team of citizen scientists whose goal is to minimize the amount of human manual image labeling needed to achieve a state-of-the-art classifier. 
					The pipeline, purpose-built to take advantage of the massive amount of unlabeled images, consists of (1) self-supervision training to convert unlabeled images into meaningful representations, (2) search-by-example to collect a seed set of similar images, (3) human-in-the-loop active learning to iteratively ask for labels on uncertain examples and train on them. 
					In initial experiments, the system has yielded orders of magnitude reduction in time and cost of data labeling efforts and has shown the potential to multiply the efficiency of the researcher's data curation efforts. </p>

			 <p>  Towards a predictive high-resolution model of high-latitude ionospheric convection using SuperDARN Radars </p>
			 <p> Investigations of the meso-scale structures garnered significant interest in recent years due to their significant contribution to the global energy budget of the Ionosphere-Thermosphere system. 
				 Perturbations at such scales are more difficult to predict due to their intricate driver dependencies and the higher spatiotemporal resolutions required to model their behaviour. 
				 In this study, we leverage the seven-year grid data from the Prince George Radar which is operated by the University of Saskatchewan to predict latitudinal and longitudinal ionospheric convection velocities.

			     <p> Uncertainty in solar wind propagation leads to biased estimates of the ionospheric response </p>
			     <p> Solar wind measurements are mainly made at the L1 libration point, 230 Earth radii upstream from the Earth. 
				     To study their impact on the Earth, we need to estimate conditions closer to Earth. 
				     The best estimates of solar wind propagation times from L1 to Earth have an uncertainty of about 10 to 50 minutes. 
				     Also, solar wind features have scale lengths ranging from 30 to 80 RE transverse to the Sun-Earth line. 
				     Shocks and rotational discontinuities propagate through the solar wind, changing its structure as a function of time. 
				     We show that these uncertainties lead to a surprising non-linear bias in the regression slopes of ionospheric response with solar wind drivers. 
				     Data-based modelers need to be aware of how this bias affects the interpretation of their results and the coupling of their model with physics-based models. 
				     Finally, we demonstrate that we can correct this bias using Bayesian techniques and prior knowledge of the uncertainties.

			 <p> An examination of HF propagation modes using machine learning guided by ray-tracing </p>
			 <p> The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) is a network of HF radars that are typically used for monitoring plasma convection in the Earth's ionosphere. 
				 Due to the complex nature of HF propagation, the radars also observe backscatter from other sources such as ground and meteor trails. 
				 However, it is not straightforward to distinguish between these different modes of backscatter observed due to the similarities in measured parameters. 
				 In this presentation, I will discuss a new machine learning algorithm that is guided by ray-tracing for identifying different backscatter modes in SuperDARN. 
				 The new model can distinguish between meteor scatter, E-/F-region ionospheric, and ground scatter. 
				 The model is validated by comparing predicted elevation angles with those measured at the radar, and the differences between these quantities can further be used to quantify the uncertainties in ionospheric parameters such as NmF2. </p>

			     <p> We investigate unsupervised time-series analysis techniques for real-time identification of magnetic field boundaries in data collected by the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) on the Cassini mission to Saturn. 
				     Previous research has sought to identify these boundaries either in a supervised setting, where a subset of labeled boundary crossing events are available to the algorithms, or using magnetometer data in which these boundaries are significantly clearer. 
				     We find that Saturn bow shock transitions can be reliably detected by the methods we consider, while magnetopause transitions are harder to identify across different years, indicating that generalization of algorithm parameters remains a challenge. 
				     We identify the Plasma Instrument for Magnetic Sounding (PIMS) on the upcoming Europa Clipper Mission as a promising beneficiary of the use of similar processing methods. </p>

			 <p> Single-Pass Subsurface Ocean Detection at Triton using the Principal Components of Magnetic Induction Measurements </p>
			 <p> There are many moons in the solar system thought to potentially harbor hidden oceans; Neptune's moon of Triton is a prime example. 
				 Magnetic induction detection is very promising due to the presence of Neptune's strong and highly dynamic magnetic field. 
				 One complication is the confounding presence of an intense ionosphere which can also generate an induced magnetic field that can mask the induction response from the putative ocean. 
				 Additionally, due to the uncertainty of Neptune's rotation rate, the phase of the synodic magnetic wave will be unknown until arrival. In this presentation, we demonstrate an ocean detection methodology based on principal component analysis that is resilient to these factors, in addition to various other noise sources. 
				 We also show how constrained ocean characterization can be achieved through a multi-pass mission concept. </p>

			     <p> Synthesizing Magnetograms of the Sun's Photosphere with Deep Learning </br> - </p>
			     <p> The Sun's magnetic field is the source of many high-energy space weather events like solar flares and so it is monitored by a set of instruments, each of which offers trade-offs between cadence, spatial and spectral resolution, and field of view. 
				     For instance, Hinode/SOT-SP is extremely accurate but has a slow cadence and limited field of view, and SDO/HMI is less spectrally capable but produces fast cadence, full-disk data. 
				     Conventionally, data from each instrument is used in isolation to infer the state of the Sun's photospheric magnetic field by inverting a forward model that maps magnetic field conditions to expected polarized light. 
				     I'll show SynthIA, a deep-learning based system that links data from multiple instruments to produce synthetic magnetograms capturing the best aspects of each instrument. 
				     In particular, I'll show that SynthIA can synthesize magnetograms with the cadence and field of view of SDO/HMI as well as the quality resembling those of the spectrally capable Hinode/SOT-SP pipeline. </p>

			 <p> Automated Boulder Detection on the Martian Surface with MBARS </p>
			 <p> Boulder-sized clasts are common on the surface of Mars, and many are sufficiently large to be resolved by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). 
				 The size, number, and location of boulders on the surface and their spatial distribution can reveal the processes that have operated on the surface, including boulder erosion, burial, impact excavation, and other mechanisms of boulder transport and generation. 
				 However, quantitative analysis of statistically significant boulder populations which could inform these processes entails prohibitively laborious manual segmentation, granulometry and morphometry measurements over large areas. 
				 We have developed an automated tool to locate and measure boulders on the martian surface: the Martian Boulder Automatic Recognition System (MBARS). 
				 The open-source Python-based toolkit autonomously measures boulder diameter and height in HiRISE images enabling rapid and accurate assessments of boulder populations. </p>

			     <p> Super-3D: Subpixel-Scale Topography Retrieval of Mars Using Deep Learning </p>
			     <p> High-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) play an important role in studying the formation processes involved in generating a modern-day planetary surface such as Mars. 
				     However, it has been a common understanding that DTMs derived from a particular imaging dataset can only achieve a lower, or at the best, similar effective spatial resolution compared to the input images, due to the various approximations and/or filtering processes introduced by the photogrammetric and/or photoclinometric pipelines. 
				     With recent successes in deep learning techniques, it is now become feasible to improve the effective resolution of an image using super-resolution restoration (SRR) networks, retrieving pixel-scale topography using single-image DTM estimation (SDE) networks, and subsequently, combine the two techniques to produce subpixel-scale topography from only a single-view input image. 
				     In this work, we demonstrate with the <a href = "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/9/1777">UCL MARSGAN SRR</a> and the <a href = "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/21/4220">MADNet SDE</a> systems to produce single-input-image-based DTMs at <a href = "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/2/257">subpixel-scale spatial resolution</a> using the 4 m/pixel ESA Trace Gas Orbiter Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) “PAN” band images and the 25 cm/pixel NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) “RED” band images.

                            <p>Upcoming missions to remote destinations like Jupiter's moon Europa will operate at extreme distances from the Earth where direct human oversight is impossible.  The combination of extreme distance, limited lifetime due to high radiation, and limited data downlink creates an urgent need for reliable autonomous operations.  Machine learning can help by analyzing data for features of interest as it is collected.  Data with positive detections can be marked for high-priority downlink to Earth for mission planning.  For Europa, such features include thermal anomalies, active icy plumes, and unusual surface mineral deposits.  This talk describes data analysis and machine learning methods that can operate onboard to increase the rate of exploration and discovery.</p>

                            <p>Global-scale energy flow throughout Earth's magnetosphere is catalyzed by processes that occur at Earth's magnetopause (MP). Magnetic reconnection is one process responsible for solar wind entry into and global convection within the magnetosphere, and the MP location, orientation, and motion have an impact on the dynamics. Statistical studies that focus on these and other MP phenomena and characteristics inherently require MP identification in their event search criteria, a task that can be automated using machine learning. We introduce a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network model into the operational data stream of the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission to free up mission operation costs, detect MP crossings, and assist studies of energy transfer into the magnetosphere. </p>

There’s a rapidly increasing need to develop “smart” autonomous algorithms capable of rudimentary science analysis on-board the spacecraft so that the downlink bandwidth can be optimized for the most relevant observations. Here, we present one such case study from the Cassini mission where we have utilized machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify whether the spacecraft was in the magnetosphere, magnetosheath or solar wind, utilizing a set of labeled magnetopause and bow shock crossings spanning from 2004 – 2016. We analyze the overall accuracy of various ML algorithms – Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) – utilizing combinations of features from the magnetometer (MAG), Charge Mass Spectrometer (CHEMS) and Low-Energy Magnetospheric Measurement System (LEMMS).</p>

                              <p>The magnetospheric physics research community uses a broad array of quantitative data-model comparison methods – metrics – when conducting their research investigations. It is often the case, though, that any particular study will only use one or two metrics. Because metrics are designed to test a specific aspect of the data-model relationship, limiting the comparison to only one or two metrics reduces the physical insights that can be gleaned from the analysis, restricting the possible findings from such studies. Additional physical insights can be obtained when many types of metrics are applied. A few best practices for choosing metrics for space physics studies are presented and discussed.</p>

A multitude of flare forecasting methods are now available for operational use, and proper evaluation of these products is crucially important for model developers, forecasters, end-users, and stakeholders because it facilitates an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the forecasting process.

                            <p>The products of magnetic reconnection in Saturn's magnetotail are identified in magnetometer observations primarily through characteristic deviations in the north-south component of the magnetic field. Identification of these features has long been performed by human observers, however with the advent of sophisticated computational methods, it is time to automate our search for these reconnection signatures. Here, we present a fully automated, supervised learning, feed forward neural network model to identify evidence of reconnection in the Kronian magnetosphere with the three magnetic field components observed by the Cassini spacecraft in Kronocentric radial-theta-phi (KRTP) coordinates as input. Furthermore, we present methods to validate results of machine learning algorithms when they are applied to extended datasets that originate in differing background environments than those trained, tested and validated against.</p>

                            <p>The surface of Mars is riddled with dunes created by accumulating sand particles that are carried by the wind. When the sand supply is limited and the wind is approximately unidirectional, dunes take the form of crescents termed barchan dunes, whose slip faces are oriented in the dominant wind direction. Consequently, analyzing the morphometrics of barchan dunes can help characterize the winds that form them. Previously, local circulation patterns were derived by analyzing individual images of barchan dunes near the North Pole of Mars <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/JB084iB14p08167">[1]</a>. However, repeating this analysis on a global scale remains a challenge, as manually mapping dunes is largely impractical and traditional computer vision algorithms are largely ineffective at identifying the outlines of dunes from images. Here we employ Mask R-CNN <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870">[2]</a>, an instance segmentation convolutional neural network, to map dunes across the surface of Mars. Training on ~1000 images, our model achieves a mean average detection precision (mAP) of 80%, for IoU = 0.5. In the talk, I will describe the Mask R-CNN neural network and its vast space of hyperparameters, and how those can be employed for object detection and analysis by incorporating traditional computer vision techniques.</p>

                <p>Mars rover operations currently consists of pre-scripted commands determined by the rover science and engineering operations teams on a day-to-day (or sol-to-sol) basis. Automated instrument targeting systems, which determine which surface features to target based on automated rather than pre-scripted decision-making, could help increase the science return from current and future exploration missions. To enable automatic follow-up observation of novel targets—i.e., targets that differ substantially from those observed previously in the mission—we propose to use novelty detection algorithms for ranking candidate targets detected in rover images. In this talk, I will present our proposed onboard novelty detection framework and illustrate its utility using diverse scenarios of novel geology found in Mars rover images.</p>

                <p> While the volumes of space physics data continue to rise exponentially, our analysis techniques have not kept pace with this rapid growth, and often do not exploit the full potential of the data. In this talk, we discuss how machine learning might provide the solution to this problem, and in particular we will show how a (sparse) time-series of point observations of some quantity can be converted into a 3-dimensional time-varying model of that quantity with the use of neural networks.   As an example, we show a three-dimensional dynamic electron density (DEN3D) model in the inner magnetosphere, that can provide full coverage of the inner magnetosphere and in fact is sufficiently accurate that it points the way to new physical discoveries. The talk will be concluded with a few emerging ideas of how machine learning can be applied in the physical sciences. </p>

                <p> Deep-Ensemble Modelling of Electron Flux at the Radiation Belt’s Outer Boundary With Bayesian Neural Networks <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rbflux-bnn">[website]</a></p>
                <p> As space-based infrastructure becomes more ubiquitous, modelling the radiation belts is increasingly important. Most radiation belt models require an accurate outer boundary condition, as this helps to drives the simulation. Our work aims to characterise the flux-energy distribution at the outer boundary location using an ensemble of Bayesian neural networks. Each model in the ensemble predicts 11 values of flux, and the associated variance, for each set of inputs.  The model performs well, predicting fluxes within a factor of 2.5 for the lower energies and within a factor of 4 for the higher energies (with a correlation between 0.5-0.8). </p>

                            <p> Advancing space physics research through machine learning and information representation: A powerful and demonstrable use case through solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling </p>
                <p>The connection between the Sun and the Earth is a complex one, involving interactions and variabilities across a dizzying spectrum of scales and systems.
                    The result is a relationship between us and our star that is observable only through a fleet of instruments, methods, and technologies yet creates weather in the near-Earth space environment colloquially known as space weather.
                    Space weather is the impact of solar energy on society and is a powerful use case for demonstrating the ability of data science to converge disciplines.
                    A key to understanding it is the way that regions of space between the Sun and the Earth’s surface are connected, particularly via particles transferred from the solar wind to the magnetosphere to the upper atmosphere—a problem that remains one of the great challenges in space physics.
                    We will first present a new ML model that better captures the dynamics of the particle precipitation from a large volume of data.
                    We will then share a new framework to evaluate and understand these models.
                    We will generalize this progress as suggestive of trends that reverberate across all scientific disciplines and that even tie science to engineering, art, and design.
                    We will raise generative questions about how we currently do AI/ML research in space physics, about the role of information representation in progressing space physics discovery (e.g., knowledge networks), and to provide insight to and spark discussion for this cross-disciplinarity community around the concepts of convergence and antidisciplinary.</p>

                    <p> Detecting Cave Entrance Candidates on Mars using Deep Learning Computer Vision </p>
                <p>In the framework of geological exploration of terrestrial planets, sinkhole-like landforms (pit craters, pit chains and skylights), as a potential direct access to the subsurface, are one of the most promising environments to focus our research.
                    Detecting, mapping, and describing those types of landforms is a challenging process since a set of tedious tasks must be conducted manually by researchers, usually on a small set of available data.
                    These tasks vary from data collection (in which areas with high probability of occurrences are selected and downloaded) to manual analysis that requires viewing the images in detail, mapping all occurrences with GIS, and extracting morphometric parameters.
                    For the Moon and Mars, databases of cave candidates exist (see MGC^3 Cushing, 2012) but all of these databases are focused on small regions, rather than at planetary scale.
                    Thus there are possible missing correlations between the presence of these landforms and the area of detection that can be related to past and present processes.
                    To achieve data analyses at planetary scale, machine learning and deep learning algorithms are extremely valuables techniques, capable of automatically analysing large datasets.
                    The main problem is that often it is necessary to develop specific tools and pipelines for this task.
                    Two jupyter notebooks have been developed around FOSS Object Detection packages and used with a small dataset of 130 high resolution images acquired by the HiRISE camera from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.
                    The aim of these is to create an user-friendly environment for training and evaluating an object detection model; not only for cave candidates but also for other types of landforms.
                    These results have been compared to available databases with preliminary promising results.</p>

                <p> Reproducibility in Space Sciences </br> Do we really need to publish our codes? </p>
                <p> Reproducibility is without a doubt one of the fundamental pillars of science, and just as science has evolved through time, so has the concept of what is necessary to ensure results are reproducible. Historically, the publication of source code used for analysis, modeling, and even for figures has never been a requirement in Space Sciences and it has rarely been encouraged as a necessary practice. A possible explanation may be the assumption that reproducibility is “baked in” the physics of the systems or in the data. However, as Machine Learning becomes an integral part of Space Sciences research, the requirement that the codes developed for research are publicly available, or at least can be obtained on demand grows in popularity. Today, many publishers are encouraging code sharing, or even straight up requiring it now or in the near future.  This talk will stray away from the traditional discussions on techniques and applications of machine learning for space and planetary sciences and focus on the topics of whether code sharing is the best practice to ensure reproducibility, with the idea of starting a conversation on whether we should push for or against code sharing as a community, and how should we prepare for it if it becomes the norm moving forward. </p>

                <p> Jupiter's decametric radio emissions have long been a valuable tool for understanding the magnetic properties of Jupiter and its interactions with its major satellites. Decametric emissions are variable on many timescales, but high-resolution observations produce huge data that can't be stored for long. Using convolutional neural networks, we try to detect, classify and  locate Jovian emissions in the observations by the Nançay decameter array. This will lead to an automated method to select the high resolution data to be archived. See predictions from this network <a href="https://voparis-minerva-jupiter.obspm.fr/">online</a>. </p>

                    <p> Exploring subsurface oceans on icy moons is a key goal in the search for habitable environments.
                    Because these moons are embedded in the time-varying magnetosphere of their host planet, their saltwater oceans generate an induced magnetic field detectable by spacecraft.
                    Such measurements provide a tool to detect and characterize these ocean worlds.
                    As part of the design of the upcoming Europa Clipper mission, we have developed a technique for ocean characterization using spacecraft magnetometry and Bayesian inference.
                    This approach allows for the recovery of the ocean parameters with robust uncertainties and enables incorporating multiple datasets into a self-consistent view of Europa's interior.
                    I will discuss the application of this technique to the upcoming Europa Clipper mission, archival data from Galileo, and possible future missions to the ice giants. </p>

                        <p> Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are a driver of space weather, the effects of which can impact high-frequency communications systems, satellite systems and pose a radiation hazard for astronauts, as well flight crew and passengers on polar flight routes.
                    The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center (NOAA/SWPC) issues space weather forecasts and products for energetic protons at Earth.
                    I will discuss a recent verification study to assess our ability to forecast these storms.
                    It is hoped that this study will serve as a benchmark for the development and validation of physics-based and machine learning SEP models. Co-authors: R. Steenburgh (NOAA SWPC), T. Onsager (NOAA SWPC), E. M. Stitely (Millersville University) </p>
